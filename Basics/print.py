# Python has a print function which takes in any number of parameters and prints
# them out on one line of text in the command line. Here it is below.

print('Hello World!');

# The above will print out to the command line 'Hello World!' This is similar to JavaScript's
# console.log() function or Java's System.out.print/println() function.
